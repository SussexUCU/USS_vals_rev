# USS valuations 2014 to 2023
Gilt yield dependence, self-sufficiency and metrics

Data for 


This review considers the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS)
valuations from 2014 to 2023. USS is a £70-80 billion Defined Benefit pen-
sions scheme with over 500,000 members who are employed (or have been
employed) at around 70 UK universities. Disputes over USS have led to
a decade of industrial action. New results are presented showing the high
dependence of USS pension contributions on the return from UK govern-
ment bonds (the gilt yield). The two conditions of the USS-specific ‘self-
sufficiency’ (SfS) definition are examined. USS data are presented along
with new analysis. It is shown that the second SfS condition of ‘maintain-
ing a high funding ratio’ dominates USS modelling to amplify gilt yield
dependence, inflating the SfS liabilities beyond the regulatory requirements,
and leading to excessive prudence. The Red, Amber and Green status of
USS metrics ‘Actual’ and ‘Target’ Reliance are also examined. It is shown
that Target Reliance tethers the cost of future pensions to the SfS definition
and that Actual Reliance can simultaneously be Green and Red. Implica-
tions for regulatory intervention are considered. An aim of this review is to
support evidence-based decision making and consensus building.
